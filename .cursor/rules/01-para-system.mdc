# PARA System Rules

## Directory Structure
The workspace follows a numbered PARA system with the following main directories:

- `00-PARA系统中心.md`: Central documentation of the PARA system
- `01-Projects/`: Active projects with specific goals and deadlines
- `02-Areas/`: Areas of ongoing responsibility
- `03-Resources/`: Reference materials and topics of interest
- `04-Archives/`: Completed or inactive projects/areas
- `05-Journal/`: Personal logs and reflections
- `06-Templates/`: Note templates and standardized formats

## File Organization Rules

1. All new files and folders must be prefixed with a number sequence
2. Files must be placed in the appropriate PARA category based on their nature
3. When in doubt about categorization, prefer `03-Resources/` or consult the user
4. Maintain the existing numerical prefix system within each directory

## Reference Files
The following files should be consulted for context:
- `F:\kit\Rainbell0\05-Journal\01-个人发展建议.md`
- `F:\kit\Rainbell0\05-Journal\02-大二下学期规划与时间安排.md`

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Scan the entire directory structure before creating new content
2. Create only one file/folder at a time
3. Follow the established naming conventions
4. Respect the existing organizational hierarchy
